#### The World Wide Web contains data in diverse formats such as documents, videos, and audios. News published online in an unstructured format (such as news, articles, videos, and audios) is relatively difficult to detect and classify as this strictly requires human expertise. However, computational techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) can be used to detect anomalies that separate a text article that is deceptive in nature from articles that are based on facts.

## This Repo contains :
### 1) Implementaion of a fake news prediction model 
### 2) Data of various news articles gathered form various data sources.
### 3) Front end implementaion using GRadio.
## NLP model used - tfidfvectorizer
Bag of words (BoW) converts the text into a feature vector by counting the occurrence of words in a document. It is not considering the importance of words. Term frequency — Inverse document frequency (TFIDF) is based on the Bag of Words (BoW) model, which contains insights about the less relevant and more relevant words in a document. The importance of a word in the text is of great significance in information retrieval.

Example — If you search something on the search engine, with the help of TFIDF values, search engines can give us the most relevant documents related to our search.
